VPM Slider
==========

This is a WordPress plugin to allows the user to create, edit and remove ‘slides’ with text and images, for example, a ‘slider’ widget to display featured items on a website homepage.

**NOTE:** VPM Slider is being developed ‘in the open’, but may not be quite ready for primetime yet. There are new features to be added, bugs to be fixed, and so on. Consider this alpha quality until we make an official announcement!

How it works
------------

VPM Slider allows you to create any number of ‘slide groups’. Each slide in the group can be given a title, some description text, a background image and, optionally, a link. You can then have these displayed in a slideshow interface on a portion of your page.

Once this plugin is installed and activated, use the Slider tab in your WordPress dashboard to assemble a group of slides with text, backgrounds and so on. You can then have the slides show up on any page of your site using the VPM Slider widget.

Go to **Appearance** > **Widgets** in WordPress and drag a new VPM Slider widget to the correct area. Then, simply select the slide group to show in this area of your site.
